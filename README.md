# pnflowPy - classical pore network flow simulation (python version)

This repository hosts the classical network flow simulation code written in python called pnflowPy. 
This code was written, not as an attempt to re-write pnflow in python, but to have a simplified version that could be easily extended to simulate other flow phenomena. Thus, the code is not as robust and fast as pnflow though could be further developed later.
